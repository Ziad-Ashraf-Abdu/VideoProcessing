## Comparison with ITF Biomechanical Guidelines

The following biomechanical parameters were analyzed and compared to the ITF guidelines based on existing literature:

### 1. **Wrist-to-Hip Distance**
The wrist-to-hip distance observed in this study is in alignment with ITF recommendations, which emphasize the importance of increasing this distance to enable effective energy transfer through the kinetic chain during the serve. This supports the generation of power and efficiency in the serve.

### 2. **Shoulder Angle**
ITF guidelines suggest that the shoulder angle during the serve should vary between 18° and 40° for optimal performance. This parameter is essential for maximizing racket speed and ensuring a powerful and accurate serve, and the results of our analysis confirm that shoulder positioning plays a critical role in this.

### 3. **Trunk Rotation**
The trunk rotation observed in our analysis, which reaches up to 170°, aligns with ITF guidelines. This rotation is essential for maximizing energy transfer during the serve, and our findings support the idea that trunk rotation is a key factor in generating serve power.

### 4. **Wrist Flexion**
Wrist flexion is crucial for racket speed and spin. The observed increase in wrist flexion during the acceleration phase aligns with the ITF recommendations, which emphasize the role of wrist pronation for both power generation and spin control.

### 5. **Impact Height**
The impact height observed in our study is within the optimal range suggested by ITF guidelines (2.1–2.3 meters). This confirms the importance of maintaining a consistent strike zone to optimize both power and spin during the serve.

### 6. **Step Distance**
While ITF guidelines do not prescribe an exact numerical range for step distance, the variations observed in our study reflect the individualized nature of the serve. Step distance plays a critical role in transferring energy from the lower body to the upper body during the serve.

### 7. **Knee Flexion**
ITF guidelines suggest that knee flexion should range from 150° to 180° for elite players. Our results are consistent with this range, confirming that knee flexion is crucial for generating force from the ground up during the serve.

## Key References in Tennis Biomechanics

### Elliott, B. (2006). "Tennis Biomechanics: The Role of Technology in the Performance Analysis of the Tennis Serve."
**Overview:** Elliott’s work is a cornerstone in understanding the various phases of the tennis serve. His research emphasizes how modern high-speed video and biomechanical analysis have broken down the serve into distinct phases. Although this paper does not directly suggest specific percentage splits, it significantly contributes to the way we perceive the tennis serve's loading, acceleration, and follow-through concepts. These concepts often form the foundation of the common percentage splits referenced in coaching.

**Influence on Our Study:** Elliott's emphasis on the division of the serve into preparation (loading), acceleration (impact), and follow-through phases directly influenced the choice to categorize the serve into three phases in our analysis. By understanding the importance of energy transfer through these phases, we adopted the traditional 30–35% for the preparation phase, 20–25% for the acceleration phase, and 40–45% for the follow-through phase. His work provides a theoretical basis for these divisions, as it highlights that the follow-through is the longest phase due to the deceleration and energy dissipation, which our results corroborate.

**Overview:** Fleisig et al. conducted a detailed analysis of the kinematics and kinetics of the tennis serve, identifying how various segments of the serve contribute to overall performance. This paper does not directly prescribe a percentage breakdown, but it does provide insight into the relative durations of different phases, with particular emphasis on the preparation and deceleration phases. It reveals that the deceleration (follow-through) phase typically requires more time to safely dissipate energy.

**Influence on Our Study:** Fleisig's work was instrumental in supporting the breakdown of the serve into three distinct phases. His analysis helped us understand that while the acceleration phase (impact) is rapid and intense, the preparation phase tends to be longer to allow for the proper weight transfer and energy storage. Furthermore, the deceleration phase is longer to ensure safe energy dissipation, which supports the allocation of a higher percentage (40–45%) to the follow-through phase. Our study used these insights to finalize the three-phase division with corresponding percentages.

### Reid, M. (2004). "Biomechanical Analysis of the Tennis Serve: A Kinetic Chain Perspective." *Strength and Conditioning Journal, 26(2), 27–35.*
**Overview:** Reid’s study explains how the kinetic chain, which is the sequence of movements that transfer energy from the legs to the racket, functions during the serve. He divides the serve into three main phases: preparation, acceleration at impact, and follow-through. This framework has influenced many coaching models, especially those that use percentage-based splits of the phases, as it aligns with the idea of progressive energy transfer during the serve.

**Influence on Our Study:** Reid’s kinetic chain model of the serve, which closely mirrors our three-phase division, was a key reference in adopting the breakdown into three phases. The percentage-based split he supports was crucial for understanding how energy is transferred from the lower body to the upper body and, ultimately, to the racket. His findings further solidified the idea that the preparation phase should be longer, the acceleration phase should be fast and intense, and the follow-through should account for a significant portion of the total time for energy dissipation and recovery.

**Overview:** Kirkendall and Garrett’s work provides a comprehensive biomechanical breakdown of the tennis serve, describing the phases of the serve and their contribution to performance. While this study does not offer specific percentage values for the phases, it outlines the general movement sequences that have been widely adopted by practitioners to inform their own models. This includes the concept that the serve can be divided into preparation, acceleration, and follow-through phases, similar to the structure found in modern coaching models.

**Influence on Our Study:** This book helped shape the general understanding that the serve is most effectively analyzed through its three primary phases. The insights provided by Kirkendall and Garrett regarding the sequential energy transfer in the serve were crucial in confirming the three-phase division. Our study follows this structure and adopts the percentages that have become standard in the literature, allowing us to segment the serve’s movements and their contributions to performance in a way that aligns with current research.

## A Note on Percentage Divisions

The decision to divide the tennis serve into three primary phases—preparation, acceleration, and follow-through—has been strongly influenced by the above studies. The typical breakdown of these phases is:

- **30–35% (Preparation):** The preparation phase is essential for loading and energy storage. The studies of Fleisig, Elliott, and Reid all emphasize the importance of this phase, noting that proper weight transfer and energy buildup are crucial for the serve’s power and efficiency.
- **20–25% (Acceleration/Contact):** This phase is the most explosive and rapid, with energy being released at ball contact. Fleisig’s work highlights the intensity of this phase, while Reid’s focus on the kinetic chain further supports its significance.
- **40–45% (Follow-through):** The follow-through phase is the longest due to the need for deceleration and energy dissipation. This phase allows the body to safely absorb the forces generated during the serve, preventing injury and preparing the player for the next movement. Elliott’s work provides a strong theoretical foundation for the extended duration of the follow-through phase.

These studies collectively underscore the importance of each phase and guide the division of the serve into these three critical components. The suggested percentage splits reflect the relative time and energy allocation during each phase, offering a practical framework for understanding and optimizing serve mechanics.
